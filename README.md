In this paper, the primary objective is to apply 
different machine learning techniques to predict outcomes of 
students in learning environments. Personalised learning is an 
integral part of modern education which compels us to tailor 
strategies suitable for the same. 

This study predicts dropout likelihood, learning styles and engagement 
levels of students by performing various ML techniques on the dataset. 
Decision Trees, K-Nearest Neighbours (KNN) and Support Vector Machines 
(SVM) are the classification models implemented on the dataset. 
Besides, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting and Logistic 
Regression were also performed on the dataset and the results 
were analyzed. Multiple techniques were used for preparation and 
pre-processing the data, handling class imbalance, encoding 
categorical data and extraction of the useful features.
